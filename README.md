# ElyBySpigot
Spigot fork with ely.by authentication instead of Mojang
## How does it work?
It works by using ely.by authlib instead mojang's official authlib which allows ely.by players to authenticate safely to the server with online mode.
## What are the drawbacks?
The drawbacks are that you cannot login to the server using Mojang


> [!] Everything is done using the official ely.by authlib installation
